## A self made documentation for STC8GK(08/17)A microcontroller.


The documentatation is still a work in progress and will be updated over time. Feel free to check back for updates or contribute if you have additional information to share.

As of now, only STC8GK(08/17)A is covered. Other variants of STC8G series may be added in the future.

> [!NOTE] 
> It works for both STC8GK08A and STC8GK17A variants, since they are similar aside from memory size
